<h1> Linked List <h1>

A linked list is a `Linear` data structure that consists of a `series of nodes`, each of which contains `data` and a `reference` to the next node. The first node in the list is called the `head`, and the last node is called the `tail`.

In simple words, a linked list consists of `nodes` where each `node` contains a `Data Field` and a `Reference` to the nest `node` in that list.


Linked lists are also used to implement graphs. A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges. The vertices represent objects, and the edges represent relationships between objects.
