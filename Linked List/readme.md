# Linked Lists in C++
This is a detailed guide on implementing linked lists in C++. A linked list is a data structure used to store a collection of elements. It consists of a series of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. Linked lists are a dynamic data structure, which means that they can grow or shrink as needed.

# Types of Linked ListsThere are several types of linked lists, including:

* Singly linked list
* Doubly linked list
* Circular linked list

# Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. The last node in the list points to a null value.

# Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node in the list. The first node in the list points to a null value for the previous node, and the last node points to a null value for the next node.

# Circular Linked List

A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the last node points to the first node in the list. This creates a circular structure.
