<font size="6">Data Structures and Algorithms in C++</font>
This is a repository containing various data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. It's intended for those who are interested in learning or practicing data structures and algorithms concepts.

Content
The repository is divided into different folders, each one containing implementations of a particular data structure or algorithm. The folders are:

Arrays: Contains implementations of various operations on arrays such as sorting, searching, and basic operations.
Linked List: Contains implementations of different types of linked lists such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, along with different operations such as insertion, deletion, and reversal.
Stack: Contains implementations of a stack data structure using an array and a linked list.
Queue: Contains implementations of a queue data structure using an array and a linked list.
Trees: Contains implementations of various types of trees such as binary trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees along with different operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Graphs: Contains implementations of different types of graphs such as directed and undirected graphs along with different operations such as BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms.
Sorting Algorithms: Contains implementations of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
Searching Algorithms: Contains implementations of various searching algorithms such as linear search, binary search, and interpolation search.
Dynamic Programming: Contains implementations of various dynamic programming algorithms such as Fibonacci series, longest common subsequence, and Knapsack problem.
Getting Started
To run the programs, you should have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. You can use any C++ compiler such as GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio.
