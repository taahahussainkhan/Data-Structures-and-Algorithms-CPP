## Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data structure that can be used to store a collection of elements. Each element in an array can be accessed using its index, which makes it easy to search for and retrieve specific elements. In this section, you will find solutions to various problems that involve using arrays.

## Linked Lists
Linked lists are a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node in the list. Linked lists can be used to implement various abstract data types such as stacks, queues, and associative arrays. In this section, you will find solutions to various problems that involve using linked lists.

## Stacks
A stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks can be used to solve various problems such as balancing parentheses and evaluating postfix expressions. In this section, you will find solutions to various problems that involve using stacks.

## Queues
A queue is an abstract data type that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues can be used to solve various problems such as implementing a cache or a buffer. In this section, you will find solutions to various problems that involve using queues.

## Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node in a tree has a parent node and zero or more child nodes. Trees can be used to represent hierarchical relationships between elements and to solve various problems such as searching and sorting. In this section, you will find solutions to various problems that involve using trees.

## Graphs
A graph is a data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Graphs can be used to represent relationships between elements and to solve various problems such as finding the shortest path between two nodes or detecting cycles in a graph. In this section, you will find solutions to various problems that involve using graphs.
